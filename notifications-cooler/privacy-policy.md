## Notifications Cooler Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2024-03-10

This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Notifications Cooler ("App" or "we") collects, uses, and discloses your information in connection with your use of our mobile application.

**Information We Collect**

The App does not collect any personal information from you. It utilizes the Android Notification Access permission to access and monitor your notification history. This access is solely for the purpose of identifying situations where you might be overwhelmed by notifications and to then activate the Do Not Disturb (DND) mode on your device.

**Use of Information**

The App uses the notification access permission to:

* Detect a surge in notifications.
* Trigger the activation of DND mode on your device (a built-in Android feature).

The App does not transmit any information collected through notification access over the internet. 

**Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of any information you provide through the use of the App. However, no internet connection or data transfer is involved, minimizing the risk of security breaches.

**Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on this page.
